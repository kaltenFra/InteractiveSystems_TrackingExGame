# InteractiveSystems_TrackingExGame
Tracking exercise. 

In this application the user interacts with the system by using his/her nose (blue), wrists (red) and hips (green).
This small webcam game has a simple setting in which the player has to 
 * catch blueberrys with the mouth, 
 * collect coins with his hands and 
 * avoid touching the capsules at the lower screen part. 
The capsules will change color with each touch according to the bodypart which has touched it. 

Counters marked by color and position are indicating 
 * how many blueberrys have been eaten,
 * how many coins have been collected by the left/right hand and 
 * how many times the left/right capsule has been touched. 
 
The aim of the game is to eat all blueberrys and collect all coins and thereby touching the capsules as less as possible. 
Enjoy it!
